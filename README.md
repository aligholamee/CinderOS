## How to run?!
As simple as always(:D), just clone the project and do:
```
make
```
The script will provide you a **ISO** file to run the operating system.

## How did that happened?
Well, this is one of my best practices on the C programming language since I started programming. It's obvious that each project(specially written in C) has its own buggy behavior sometimes.
Please feel **free** to contribute.
